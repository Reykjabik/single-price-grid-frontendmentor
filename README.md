## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this simple exercise I only got my feet wet with CSS Grid. This is a fairly easy grid to create, so it didn't take long. At least I got to practice the simplest commands like *grid-template-columns/row* and *grid-column-start/end*.

This was also a good opportunity to create my first animation, just a font growing on hover. I still need to see what other types of animations can be created and how customizable are they. 

### Continued development

Animations. I can see there are lots of options and they can be combined to achieve some very impressive results.

And definitely, more complex grids.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Yet again I kept this page open to learn about the implementation of CSS grids.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10189356/how-to-add-screenshot-to-readmes-in-github-repository) - This helped me keep the final state of the animation frozen, instead of starting a cycle again.
